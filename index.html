<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to My Website.</h3>

<p>I made this website as a project in my CS3 class at SMASH Stanford using GitHub, a web-based repository service that helps teams cooperate on a project and helps programmers publish their work.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Purpose of this Blog</h3>

<p> I haven't really decided what I want to do with this page yet. Going in I had plenty ideas, like a suicide blog with a forum and chat groups, a place to star pictures of my drawings, an online journal, etc. But really I think the best thing is just to gain the skills and knowledge to do with this page what I please. It's up and online and I can change it freely. So really the title "Namdi's Blog" is a placeholder.</p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7UK6gSo.png?1" alt="A screenshot of my work on the project."> <p>This is a screenshot of my work on this website. I used brackets to open a local copy of the website and then work on it along side a copy that updated manually whenever I saved my changes in bracket. The making part wasn't so hard. The problem was getting this thing online which involved less code but more difficult processes than this entire website.</p>
